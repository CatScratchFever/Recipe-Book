v0.5.2


[Python]A digital recipe book to be used on a raspberry pi and 7" touchscreen. Makes use of tkinter and Pillow for the GUI.
Place all files into a directory (C:/Python/RecipeBook or /home/pi/RecipeBook, etc.)

Add more recipes into the Recipes folder and appropriate sub-directory, write your own recipe text file!

(This is my first serious computer app, many issues probably!)

Run "run.py" to open the program.
